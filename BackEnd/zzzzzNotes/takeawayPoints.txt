MIDDLEWARES

middleware are the function which has req, res and next
to trigger another middleware, we have to call next()

two types of middleware
normal middleware
        (req, res, next)=>{}
        to trigger next middleware we have to call next()

error middleware
        (err, req, res, next)=>{}
        to trigger next error middleware, we have to call next("someValue")
